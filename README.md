# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction  
---

## 📌 Overview  
Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses, especially in telecom, banking, and e-commerce.  
This project predicts **customer churn** using machine learning techniques, enabling organizations to:  
✅ Retain customers  
✅ Reduce revenue loss  
✅ Improve decision-making  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 🔍 Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior  
- 🤖 Train **ML models** to predict churn with high accuracy  
- 📊 Evaluate models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC**  
- 💡 Provide **business insights** to reduce churn  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
Two datasets are used:  
1. **client_data.csv** – Customer demographics & subscription details  
2. **price_data.csv** – Billing & pricing information  

### 📝 Features:  
- 🆔 Customer ID  
- 👤 Age, Gender  
- 📄 Contract Type  
- 💵 Monthly Charges, Total Charges  
- ⏳ Tenure  
- 🎯 Churn (Yes/No - Target variable)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📊 **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn, Random Forest, XGBoost**  
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
